  storyText: 'This person on the phone certainly seems to have your preservation
    in mind, but there''s no way they know for certain when the coast is clear. You
    saw the two men depart, and this is your chance to duck.

    

    You go
    into a crouched position and crab walk out of the cubicle. Immediately to your
    right, you see a police officer standing mere feet away, looking right at you.

    

    "He''s
    here! I found him!" The officer reaches for the handcuffs on his belt.

    

    1.
    Run in the opposite direction

    2. Run into the officer in an attempt to
    knock him down and run past him.'
