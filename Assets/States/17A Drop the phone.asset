  storyText: 'You let the phone fall from your hand and watch it plummet to the ground,
    bouncing off the side of the building and sending it into a spin. It becomes
    too small to follow with your eyes, but you''re fairly certain you heard a faint
    crack! as it hit the ground.


    1. Continue towards the scaffold.

    2.
    Be a little bitch and go back inside.'
