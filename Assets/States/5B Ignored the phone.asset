  storyText: 'You become intensely aware of the noise coming from your cubicle, but
    you have no interest in answering a phone that isn''t yours. You can hear a couple
    coworkers in adjacent cubes scoffing at the noise, but you just play dumb.

    

    A
    few moments later you hear several sets of footsteps approaching. You turn around
    and see your supervisor flanked by two men in suits.

    

    "This is him,"
    says your supervisor to the two men. They step forward immediately and stand
    over you, their presence intimidating.Your supervisor seems a little apprehensive
    at this sudden show of aggression and mutters something about needing to finish
    a report. He walks away.

    

    The two men escort you out of the building
    and then they kill you because you didn''t answer the phone, you fuck.
