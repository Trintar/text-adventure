  storyText: 'You become intensely aware of the ringing noise coming from your cubicle,
    but you have no interest in answering a phone that isn''t yours. You can hear
    a couple coworkers in adjacent cubes scoffing at the noise, but you just play
    dumb.


    A few moments later you hear several sets of footsteps approaching.
    You turn around and see three men in suits, flanked by a number of police officers.


    One
    of the men steps forward and stands over you, his presence quietly intimidating.


    "Hello,
    Mr. Anderson. I have some questions for you and I would like for you to join
    us."


    There was no hint of a question to his proposal and you find yourself
    standing up at these words. The men escort you out of the building and then they
    kill you because you didn''t answer the phone, you fuck.
