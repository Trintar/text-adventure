  storyText: 'You can''t handle going out onto the ledge like this. It''s just too
    much. You''d rather take your chances with the men in suits.


    As you have
    just accepted this, the door slowly swings open and you see the three men in
    suits walk in one after another.


    "Mr. Anderson," says the man in front.
    "We would like you to come with us for some questioning."


    They bind your
    hands and lead you downstairs. There you see a sweet motorcycle with a person
    clad in black leather swear under their breath and drive off. The end.
