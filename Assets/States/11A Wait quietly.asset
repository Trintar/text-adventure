  storyText: 'Several seconds pass in silence. You can hear the men approaching your
    cubicle and the shuffling of feet. You take a chance to peek and see two men
    silently making eye contact with one another after looking into your empty cubicle.
    They then wordless walk away in opposite directions, probably to look for you
    elsewhere.

    

    The voice on the phone speaks again. "When I tell you,
    go to the end of the row to the office at the end of the hall. Stay as low as
    you can."

    

    1. Wait for the cue.

    2. Go now. The coast is clear
    and you cannot afford to wait.'
