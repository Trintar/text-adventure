  storyText: "You decide to wait for the cue from the person on the phone. They've
    been correct about everything up to now, so there's no reason to think they aren't
    correct now. Only a few seconds pass before the voice speaks to you again.\r\n\r\n\"Go.
    Now.\"\r\n\r\nYou go into a crouched position and sneak out of the cubicle. To
    your immediate right is a police officer with his back to you. You go left as
    instructed, to reach the end of the row of cubicles, staying low as instructed.\r\n\r\nAs
    you pass through the next set of cubicles you approach a copy machine being used
    by a coworker. They see you and have a look of confusion at you hurriedly moving
    through the office while crouched.\r\n\r\n1. Continue to the office.\r"
