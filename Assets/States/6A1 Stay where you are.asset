  storyText: 'You stay where you are, barely peering over the cubicle and watch as
    the men in suits begin walking briskly towards your cubicle, not bothering to
    take in any of their surroundings. You notice each of them wearing dark sunglasses
    and their suits are identical.

    

    They must be some government agents,
    you think to yourself.

    

    1. Duck back into your cubicle. "What the
    hell do they want from me?"

    2. Sit down and wait in your cubicle to see
    what the men want.'
