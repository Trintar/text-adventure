    Slowly
    rising you peer above your cubicle wall.


    "The elevator," says the voice
    on the phone.


    You turn your gaze to the elevator and see three men in suits
    accompanied by several police officers speaking to one of your coworkers. They
    are far enough away that you cannot quite make out who they are, but your coworker
    has just pointed in the direction of your cubicle.


    The men''s heads turn
    in unison and look towards you.


    1. Duck quickly. "Shit!"

    2. Stay where
    you are and try to see them more clearly.'
