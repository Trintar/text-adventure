  storyText: 'You continue moving through the rows of cubicles and make it to the
    office the voice on the phone was talking about. You quietly open the door and,
    after a quick glance around to make sure you were not followed or seen, step
    inside and close the door.


    "Good," says the voice immediately. "Now, outside
    there is a scaffold." You look to your right and see the scaffold hanging outside,
    level with the office window.


    1. "How do you know all of this?"'
